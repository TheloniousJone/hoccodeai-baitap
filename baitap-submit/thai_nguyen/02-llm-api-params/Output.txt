The young man's name was Santiago. Dust swirled as he entered a ruined chapel with his flock of sheep. The roof had fallen in long ago, and a large mulberry tree had taken root where the statue of the saint once stood.

Santiago decided to make camp there for the night. He made sure all the sheep had gone through the crumbling door, then propped some sticks against it to prevent them from wandering off during the night. There weren't any foxes in the area, but once, some sheep had strayed during the night, and it had taken him the whole next day to find them.

He swept the floor with his cloak and lay down, using the book he had just finished reading as a pillow. He told himself that he would start reading thicker books: they would last longer and make more comfortable pillows.

The sky was still dark when he woke up, and looking up, he could see the stars shining through the ruined roof of the chapel.

He wanted to sleep a little longer, he thought. He had had a dream, just like the one a week earlier, and he had woken up before it ended.

He sat up and took his shepherd's crook, starting to wake the sheep, who were still drowsy. He noticed that as soon as he woke up, most of the sheep also began to stir. There seemed to be a mystical connection between his own life and the life of the flock, who he had been shepherding for two years, guiding them through the wilderness to find food and water. “They know their time too well,” he murmured to himself. Thinking about it for a moment, he realized that perhaps there was another way: that he had gotten too used to their time.

But there were some sheep who needed more time to wake up. He had to nudge each one with his crook, calling their names. He always believed that each sheep could understand what he was saying. So sometimes he read to them parts of books that had impressed him, or he told them about the loneliness or happiness of a shepherd on the plains. Occasionally he would comment to them on the things he had seen in the towns they had passed through.

But for the last few days he had only spoken to them about one thing…



The young woman, the merchant's daughter, was to arrive within three or four days. The man had only visited the village once the previous year. The merchant owned a dry goods stall and always insisted on shearing the sheep in front of him to avoid being deceived. A friend had told him about the stall, and he had brought his flock there.

"I want to sell some sheep's wool," the man said to the merchant.

The shop was bustling, and the owner asked the sheepherder to wait until afternoon.  So the man sat on the steps of the shop and took a book out of his bag to read. 

"I don't know, can shepherds read?" a young woman's voice rang out behind him. 

She was a special type of girl from Andalusia, Spain, with flowing black hair and hypnotic eyes reminiscent of the conquerors of Morocco.

"Oh, usually I learn more from my sheep than from books," he replied. For two hours they chatted. She told him she was the merchant's daughter and talked about life in the village, where every day was the same. The shepherd told her about the wilds of Andalusia and related stories about the different towns he had visited. It was a welcome change from talking to the sheep.

"How did you learn to read?" the girl asked.

"Like everyone else," the man said, "at school."

"Oh, if you can read, why are you just a shepherd?"

The man mumbled an answer to avoid responding to the girl's question. He was sure she would never understand.  He launched into stories about his travels, and the girl's eyes, Moroccan in their depth, widened with fear and wonder. As time passed, he found himself wishing that this day would never end and that he could spend the next three days with her. He realized he was feeling something he had never felt before:  a longing for a permanent place to call home.  His days with this dark-haired girl would never be the same.  

But finally the merchant appeared, ordering him to shear the sheep.  





He paid him in a load of wool and told the young shepherd he would return next year.
